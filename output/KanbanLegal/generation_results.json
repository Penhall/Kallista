                "1. **Authentication**: The proposed token-based authentication is a good start. However, an additional layer of security can be achieved by implementing multi-factor authentication. This would require users to provide at least two forms of valid credentials before gaining access.",
                "2. **Authorization**: Authorization rules should be applied to ensure that users can only access and perform actions on data that they are authorized to. For instance, a user should not be able to delete or edit a task that they did not create.",
                "3. **Input validation**: All input from the client should be validated before processing. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks and other forms of data manipulation.",
                "4. **Transmission security**: To protect the data during transmission over the network, HTTPS should be used for all API calls. This will ensure that all data is encrypted during transmission and cannot be intercepted or tampered with.",
                "5. **Error Handling**: Be careful with the information included in the error messages. Detailed error messages can provide attackers with insights about the system. Instead, log the detailed error information server-side where it's secure, and send a generic error message to the client."
