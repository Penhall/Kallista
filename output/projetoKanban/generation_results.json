                "1. Secure the API: Since the service layer and APIs are being implemented using ASP.NET Core, it is vital to secure the API endpoints. This can be achieved by implementing authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity. It provides features such as password hashing, user lockout, two-factor authentication which helps in preventing unauthorized access.",
                "2. Implement the Repository Pattern: This is an excellent approach to ensure data security and integrity. By using a repository for each entity in the database, it is possible to centralize the data logic and rules, making it easier to maintain and secure.",
                "3. Use Data Transfer Objects(DTOs): DTOs are used to ensure data integrity and security during data transfer between the client and the server. They allow you to control exactly what data you want to expose and can be used to hide sensitive data, reducing the risk of data leaks.",
                "4. Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection(DI) is a technique that helps in achieving loose coupling between objects and their dependencies. Using DI can improve the security of the application as it allows for the use of interfaces or abstract classes which can restrict the access to certain methods or data.",
                "5. Validate User Input: Always validate user input on the server-side even if it is validated on the client-side. Implementing this will help to prevent SQL Injection attacks, Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) attacks and it will also help to ensure that only valid data is being processed by the application."
